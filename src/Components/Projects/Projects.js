      description: "I recently achieved a milestone in my cloud computing journey by deploying Docker containers on AWS EC2 instances and automating the entire process with Terraform. This project involved manually setting up Docker on EC2, followed by automating the deployment and infrastructure setup using Terraform scripts. The result is a consistent, scalable, and efficient deployment process, highlighting the power of Infrastructure as Code."

      description: "To deploy a project on AWS, first clone the repository and set up the project locally with npm install and npm run start. Then, create and configure an EC2 instance on AWS, connect via SSH, and install necessary tools. Finally, clone the project on the EC2 instance, configure an Elastic IP, and start the project, adjusting security group rules to allow traffic."
