This project involved manually setting up Docker on EC2, followed by automating the deployment and infrastructure setup using Terraform scripts. The result is a consistent, scalable, and efficient deployment process, highlighting the power of Infrastructure as Code."

Then, create and configure an EC2 instance on AWS, connect via SSH, and install necessary tools. Finally, clone the project on the EC2 instance, configure an Elastic IP, and start the project, adjusting security group rules to allow traffic."
